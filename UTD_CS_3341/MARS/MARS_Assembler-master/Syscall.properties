# Example of re-assign syscall number. Remove leading "#" to activate.
# I re-assign to same number since I don't really want to change them.
# None are necessary here since number is assigned as constructor arg.
# Re-assignment here will override constructor arg though.
# The syscall names must match constructor arg exactly, case-sensitive.
# Re-assignment useful if numbering conflict should someday occur.
